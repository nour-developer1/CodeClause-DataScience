# CodeClause-DataScience
A repo for my project as a Data Scientist 
# Project Telcom-Customer-Chrun 
I worked on 
 Explore and analyze the telecom dataset to understand customer behavior.
 
 Implement Logistic Regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm, for churn prediction.
 
 Evaluate the model's performance with key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall score.
