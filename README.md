# CodeClause-DataScience
A repo for my project as a Data Scientist 
# Project Telcom-Customer-Chrun 
I worked on 
 Explore and analyze the telecom dataset to understand customer behavior.
 
 Implement Logistic Regression, a powerful machine learning algorithm, for churn prediction.
 
 Evaluate the model's performance with key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall score.

# Dataset Context :
"Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." [IBM Sample Data Sets]

# Dataset content :
Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
